# 💸 Personal Finance Manager

Personal Finance Manager is a full-featured Spring Boot–based web application developed by **me, Vishnu Urugonda**, as a solo project to demonstrate backend development skills in Java and Spring.

It enables users to manage their personal finances by securely tracking incomes, expenses, setting financial goals, and generating detailed reports.

- Session-based security (Spring Security)
- Clean RESTful API structure
- Unit testing with JUnit and Mockito
- YAML-based config and profiles

🔗 Live URL: https://personal-finance-manager-ix14.onrender.com

The project includes a Dockerfile that builds and runs the Spring Boot JAR using multi-stage Docker builds. This ensures portability and ease of deployment.

## 🔐 User Credentials
By default, users need to register with a unique username and password to access the application.

**Register**: Create your own username and password via the registration page.

**Login**: Use the registered username and password to log in.

Passwords are securely hashed with BCrypt for safety.

For Testing or Demo Purposes
You can use the following default test user credentials (if you have seeded any) or create your own:
| Username   | Password    |
| ---------- | ----------- |
